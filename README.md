# Flask-Project-Manager
Using the flask framework to create a (very) simple project manager

You can add projects and add tasks to those projects. When you are done with the tasks and the project, you can simply delete them.

This is not anything serious. This was just a small project which I worked on for about 30 minutes a day during my break from high school,
while simultaneously learning a tiny bit more about web dev. That is why I did not do any error handling, using a specific workflow/structure and did not host it.

I am not fully into web development or any  other niche yet. Over the last year I have experimented with different stuff like game development, etc.. 
I now plan to do dedicated research in what niche of programming I am interested in. 

Any criticism and stuff I could have done better would be appreciated.
